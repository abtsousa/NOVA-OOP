My solutions to the exercises and homeworks of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 2022/2023 Course at FCT NOVA.

The language used was Java.

Each exercise is in its own numbered subfolder (1 per week) and has a small txt or PDF file with a quick explanation of what we were told to do.

There's also a couple of (bigger) final projects that were made with @R-Bartmoss and are published in their own repo NOVA-OOP-FinalProjects. Each one had a two-week deadline.
